# Homepage Project

This is a simple personal homepage project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to build a personalized webpage that serves as a homepage.

## Getting Started

To view the homepage, you need to use an HTTP server to serve the files locally. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the `http-server` package globally by running the following command:
npm install -g http-server


4. Once the installation is complete, run the `http-server` command to start the server:
http-server

5. The server will provide you with a link, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Open this link in your web browser to view the homepage.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the homepage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements and provides the visual design of the homepage.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the homepage.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the content and styling of the homepage. You can update the text, add new sections, or modify the CSS styles. You can also use Bootstrap to add additional styling and components to the site.

## Testing

If you want to see how the site looks while you work on it, you can run a local server or use a code editor with a built-in live server feature. Command- or control-click on the first link presented by the local server or live server, which should open the webpage in a new tab. You should then be able to refresh the tab containing the webpage to see your latest changes.
